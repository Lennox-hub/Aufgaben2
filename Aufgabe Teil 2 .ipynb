    "**Part 2: Create a stock-picking portfolio based on fundamental stock characteristics**\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Excel sheet contains 13 time series of fundamental stock characteristics (“factors”), such as Momentum, Valuation, Profitability, Risk. It also contains 2 time series of monthly returns, one in EUR and one in the local currency of each stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to build a predictive model that creates a portfolio at the end of each month (i.e. a vector of weights) based on the factor values known at that point in time. The model should maximize the time series hit rate of local currency returns, i.e. the proportion of months where the portfolio’s local currency return is higher than the mean local currency return of the (non-delisted) stocks. Transaction costs can be ignored. Your model may be evaluated on a different list of stocks but with the same factors and dates, so make sure your code is flexible enough to handle a different number of stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should contain a clear description of your model and document its performance by simulating the implied portfolio and monthly return series. You can do all transformations to the factors (normalizing, filing missing data, etc.) that you think make sense. Discuss the model you built in a few sentences. Does it work well? What are its weaknesses? What would you change if you had more time? Do you think it will work well on a different set of stocks? Use figures or tables to illustrate your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the goal is to show that you know how to work with Python, so the focus is more on the quality of the code than on the model."
